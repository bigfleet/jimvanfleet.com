I sit at the gate.  This plane will take me to <span class="caps">JFK</span>.  The plane after that one will take me to Portland, Oregon for RailsConf 2007.  I am an hour ahead of time.  I have mostly conquered my cough and runny nose.  I have an exit row window seat on the flight from <span class="caps">JFK</span> to Portland-- hallelujah!


I began my journey with a great deal of personal and professional self-assurance.  That won't last long!  But I am eager to see what the next few days have in store.
