I've been doing some looking around at some various technical topics, and here are the results.

### Back to Reston

I am going to attend the November [NFJS](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/) conference in Reston in early November.  I'm interested to see the new workshops, this get together promises to be just as interesting as the first.  Maybe I'll try to be more sociable.

### Tapestry Demoted to <span class="caps">AAA</span>

I think that <a href="http://devblog.jimvanfleet.com/archives/000016.html">Tapestry</a> has found its way to the minors.  I was reading Tapestry In Action, and the much-discussed learning curve simply seems too steep.  There's a very important Tapestry construct called &#8220;rewind mode&#8221; that places specific restrictions on how the end developer codes.  At some point, we've all got to turn the works over the code monkeys (after first being one ourselves) and I just don't think it'll work.

If you have a smart team, maybe it'll be fine for you.  I certainly don't want to say anything derogatory, but it does not seem to fit my needs.  I may, at some point, decide that the speed with which a new web page is developed doesn't matter, but it can't be right now.  

### No Echo

I checked out the [Echo](http://echo.nextapp.com/site/index.html) framework, which is totally unsuitable.  I expect to put massive amounts of JavaScript and top-notch <span class="caps">HTML</span> designs in our pages; Echo is simply a non-starter with this requirement.  You will think that you are coding a <span class="caps">SWING</span> app.  

[EchoPoint](https://echopoint.sourceforge.net/) and its [CSS](https://echopoint.sourceforge.net/LinkedArticles/CascadingStyleSheets.html) support</a> look good, but specifying <span class="caps">CSS</span> texts in Java code does not seem like a good solution to me.  You wouldn't put <span class="caps">HTML</span> text in Java code, and I see only a subtle difference between the two.  Looks like I'll have to check out Java Server Faces next.  I somehow have a feeling we'll be ending up with Spring <span class="caps">MVC</span> and a lot of custom code writing.

### It's a Gem

I've been fiddling with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), motivated by the support of the [Pragmatic Programmers](https://pragprog.com/), and the very impressive video demo of [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), which is worth downloading Quicktime to watch, if you're into web applications.    I love <span class="caps">OS X</span>, but I don't have it.  I'm trying to bluff my way through a Windows / CygWin installation and it is not pretty.  More updates when I have them.
