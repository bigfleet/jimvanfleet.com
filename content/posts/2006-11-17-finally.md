The blog has found its next home.  The poor thing.  It might not be anywhere close to finished, either.  I'm not sure where it will be housed next.  I'm fairly certain that the next event will be a transformation into a [Mephisto](http://www.mephistoblog.com/) backed blog with a custom theme (although I may start with the one that I ported for CVREG).  But one can never tell in this crazy world!

I should be getting back into the lovely rhythm I had before the blog went down.  I'm getting a lot done while enjoying myself pretty consistently.  I'd love to be able to keep that up.
