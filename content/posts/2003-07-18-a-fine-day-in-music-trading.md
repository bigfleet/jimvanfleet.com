They won't end up on [my list](http://db.etree.org/bigfleet) for some time yet, but as a combination of downloading and the mail yesterday, these show got added to my incoming shows:

* Coldcut, DJ Food, and <span class="caps">DJ Z</span>-Trip 12-25-00, Solid Steel Radio
* DJ Krush 12-4-01, Live in Rochester, NY
* DJ Shadow and DJ Krush, 10-11-95, Live in Leeds
* A Tribe Called Quest,  11-24-98
* Black Eyed Peas, 12-14-02
* De La Soul, 10-28-01
* Del The Funkee Homosapien, 11-22-2002
* Outkast 7-31-2001

This doesn't even include some shows that came in that turned out to be <span class="caps">MP3</span> sourced.   Some of those are new to eTree, which makes me happy.  Any one of those shows above would have made the day feel like a success, so having all of them come in at once was very exciting to me.

I do have plans for a healthy subsystem of links to musical acts.  In another month, I should be done with my contracting projects, allowing my free time to be my free time.  (Won't *that* be something!)  Then I'll at least have some time to think about it and see what I can do.  I am definitely all about spreading the musical love.
