The good news is that I've been offered a full-time position at [the company I've been working for since Christmas](http://www.dominion-medical.com/).

The bad news is that the salary they've offered represents a serious paycut (about 20%) of what they're currently paying me as a contractor.

The benefits are good (perhaps very good), but I just don't know if the numbers work together.  Megan and I just did our budget, and it looks just right to me at my current salary.

I am very nervous right now, but it's the good kind of nervous that comes with a big opportunity.

I'll make sure to keep all of you up to date on what's going on.
