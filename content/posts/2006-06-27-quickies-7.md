I've had to start tagging random horribleness on the net from the [RIAA](https://pinboard.in/u:bigfleet/t:riaa/) in addition to [George Bush](https://pinboard.in/u:bigfleet/t:bush/).  *AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH*!

The [Jerk/Genius](http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2006/06/now_whos_a_bigg.html) ratio for the Van Fleet family is astronomical, at just under 13 (11,400 to about 900).  The ratio for myself personally is closer to 3 (23/7), but none of them are referring to anyone named Jim Van Fleet actually being a jerk.

God, I am getting so sad that I read a post on John Batelle's Search Blog  and think, "He's absolutely right."
