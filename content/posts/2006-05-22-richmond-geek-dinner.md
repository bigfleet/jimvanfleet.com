I am hosting a Richmond Geek Dinner in one month, June 22nd, 2006 at The Bull And Bear Club in downtown Richmond.</p>

There will be free wine, provided courtesy of [Hugh MacLeod](https://www.gapingvoid.com/) and his [100 Geek Dinners in 100 Days](https://www.baselinemag.com/small-and-medium-business-it/Web-20-Turning-Browsers-into-Buyers/) program, which looks like it may reach its numbers shortly as of this posting.


For those who have expressed concern about the price, please visit the first link about this dinner.  The Bull And Bear Club does have a dress code, but it is not an expensive place to eat, necessarily.  There are many sandwiches and chicken dishes available for less than $10.  Presumably, this is how much a dinner out would cost you.
