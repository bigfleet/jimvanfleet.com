I am going absolutely crazy reading blogs and adding to my bookmarks.  Here's an example of one of the good things I've come across.  The conjecture is that [you can get the equivalent of an <span class="caps">MBA</span> education by reading books.](https://personalmba.com/)

There's not as much value, obviously, but it's a lot cheaper.  By the way, these are the books I'm devouring these days.
