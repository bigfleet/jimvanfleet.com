[Self-Referential Aptitude Test](http://www.chaos.org.uk/~eddy/craft/srat-Q.html)

First, the instructions are massively useful in completing this test.  Keep this in mind as we progress.

Second, this is just one possible walkthrough, and it's the second time I have gone through the test.  It was *much* harder the first time.

### Easy Ones:

It's my sincerest wish that identity will hold in this exam;  the answer to #5 is _E_.

#20 gets special attention in the instructions, and by consulting reference material, we establish that answer is _E_

### Warming Up:

Questions #10 and #16 refer to each other.  The only correct set of answers possible means #10 is _A_ and #16 is _D_.

Questions #6 and #17 refer to each other.  When one considers that the answer to #17 cannot be D because of question #2, the only correct set of answers; #6 is _D_, and #17 is _B_.

The instructions state that the solution to the quiz is unique.  I am not afraid to use shortcuts, so let's do some analysis on #12.  Uniqueness would imply that neither C,D, nor E could be the answer, as that would necessitate A or B also being a possible answer.  Thus, not only can we eliminate C,D, and E as choices, we also establish that the number of consonants cannot be in the following:


* 1, 4, 9, 16 (perfect squares)
* 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 (primes)
* 10, 15, 20 (divisible by 5)

This means that the number of consonant answers can be either 6, 8, 12, 14, or 18.  These are all even numbers, so the answer to #12 is _A_.

#15 directly references this answer, so #15 is also _A_.  #15 is now established as the only odd-numbered question with the answer of A, which means the answer to #13 is _D_.

```
Catchup:

 1. ?   6. D  11. ?  16. D
 2. ?   7. ?  12. A  17. B
 3. ?   8. ?  13. D  18. ?
 4. ?   9. ?  14. ?  19. ?
 5. E  10. A  15. A  20. E
```


### Let Me See

#1 cannot possibly be A or B and remain internally consistent.  There are already two questions answered E so #1 cannot be C.  The answer to #5 is E, eliminating E as a possibility.  The answer to #1, therefore, is _D_.  This means the answer to #4 is _B_.

#4 states that there are 5 A's, and we already have two E's.  This means that the only possible answer to #8 is _E_.  There are eight vowels and twelve consonants.  The answer to #3 is _D_, as 8 vowels --- 5 A's = 3 E's.  We have eight vowels and twelve consonants.

### My Head Is Starting To Hurt A Little:

#9 is not A because of the answer to #13 indicates that #15 is the only odd-numbered question with the answer A.  It cannot be C because the answer to #12 is not C.  It cannot be E because we already have 3 E's per #3.  Suppose the answer to #9 was B.  The answer to #11 would then necessarily be B but that would be a contridiction, since the answers to #4 and #9 would be B.  Hence the answer to #9 is _D_.

The answer to #11 cannot be A since #4 is B.  Hence the answer to #2 must be A as the other answers have been established.  This means the answer to #7 is _D_.  We can now count to see that the answer to #11 is _B_.

```
Catchup:

 1. D   6. D  11. B  16. D
 2. A   7. D  12. A  17. B
 3. D   8. E  13. D  18. ?
 4. B   9. D  14. ?  19. ?
 5. E  10. A  15. A  20. E

```

### Almost There:

Let's do a little letter counting.

A: 4
B: 3
C: 0
D: 7
E: 3

#18 cannot possibly be B, C, or D because of the letter counts and number of questions left.  It cannot be E because of #3.  #18 must be _A_, satisfying the A requirement of 5.

#14 and #19 must therefore both be _B_ to make 5 answers B.  We see that the count for letter D in question #14 is correct.

Give yourself a pat on the back for asking the indomitable #19!  Note also that the answer spells <span class="caps">DAD BEDDED A BAD BAD BABE</span>, which the author recognizes as a Fatal Attraction reference.  What a great test!
