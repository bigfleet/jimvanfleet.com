We hosted Thanksgiving yesterday for the families.  Megan's folks came down early, since Megan's mom had volunteered for the cooking.  My sister and parents came later, bringing a cheese plate and the wine.

It was a great meal, and I had a great time.  Everybody seemed comfortable and enjoyed each other's company.  That was a great feeling.

I'm thankful for all the gifts that God has given me, and I continue to hope that I am worthy of them.

Also, thanks everybody for reading my blog.
