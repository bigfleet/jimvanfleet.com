* I just tonight started feeling fully better from my <span class="caps">NYC</span> illness.  Sorry if I've been tardy with e-mails and the like.  I'll catch up very soon.
* The job is going OK.  It looks like it'll take me to Houston next week.  It should be interesting to get back to town-- and I'll love seeing Freebird's again!  If you're from there, expect to hear from me soon enough.
* It's raining ice here.  It sounds so odd.
* Christmas looks like clothes this year.  That could be worse.
