Naked Objects is a  [thoroughly researched](http://www.nakedobjects.org/) assessment of the focus problems of our industry.  We deal with technical problems, day in and day out, so it's easy to avoid the big, scary questions.  Naked Objects ask the question, "Why can't we just write the business objects and leave the rest to the user?"

While I doubt that I'll adopt the framework for projects in their entirety, I can easily see using the rapid prototyping capabilities.  How about whipping up something that actually worked between the first two days of a preliminary requirements meeting?  And then being able to keep that around to test the early stages of your persistence framework and interface?  I'll keep you posted on any futher developments or use of the framework.
