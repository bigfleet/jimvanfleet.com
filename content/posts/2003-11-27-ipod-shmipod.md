I got an [iRiver iHP-120](https://www.theverge.com/23795072/iriver-mp3-player-retro-gadgets-we-love) the other day at Comp-USA.  I used a $25 gift card that my dad got last Christmas and gave to me.  It didn't come cheap, but it's *the hotness.*


I'll probably have a full review in mind when I come back from <span class="caps">NYC</span>, but my initial impressions are all quite favorable.
