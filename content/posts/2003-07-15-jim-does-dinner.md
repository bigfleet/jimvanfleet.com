The recipe was the sauce for a Jamaican Jerk sauce.  I'll provide it, because I like to share.

{{<amzn asin=bmdlafH title="The Barbecue! Bible">}}

* 2 to 16 scotch bonnet chiles.  Habeneros also work.
* 2 bunches scallions, white and green parts, cut into 1 inch pieces
* 1/2 medium onion, cut into 1 inch pieces
* 1 piece fresh ginger, thinly sliced
* 3 cloves garlic, peeled
* 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, or 2 teaspoons dry
* 2 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 3 tablespoons (kosher or sea) salt
* 1 tablesppon firmly packed brown sugar

1. Combine the chiles, scallions, onion, ginger and garlic in a food processor and process until finely chopped.
1. Add the thyme, allspice, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, vinegar, soy sauce, oil, salt and sugar and process to a smooth purï¿½e.

There you go!  That's the sauce.  I'm not going to do the whole recipe, which yields yummy pork tenderloins.  I highly recommend the book, it's got plenty of great dishes even for people who eat things beside meat.
