The show itself was tight.  Skillz was awesome, the highlight of the night.  I would jump at the chance to go see Skillz as a headliner.  When he stepped on stage to rap that first joint, it was _tiiiight_, and the CD's I picked up of his seem to indicate that he has the material to pull it off.  Rumor is that he's leaving Rawkus as well.

Jean Grae was incredible as well, I got albums from them both.  J-Live was awesome, but I have his rekkids.  Vast Aire had a sore throat and couldn't go.  Everyone on OK Player forums was talking up Little Brother.  They were enjoyable and all that, and they did their jobs, but I didn't feel it all that much.  Everyone talks bad about the Def Jux performance.  Sure, it wasn't the same crunk level as everything else-- but I guess these people are used to dancing for three hours straight.  I have to have a little bit of down time myself.

As for my plans to tape, I at least have all the gear now, and I actually asked the sound guys about it.  I forgot my permission slip from [BTAT](http://btat.wagnerone.com), though, so that was as far as I got.  Someday-- maybe My Morning Jacket at the Canal Club at the end of the month.
