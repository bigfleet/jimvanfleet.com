Three balls in the hopper:

I'm very close to the end of my previous job at Dominion Medical Management.  It's been tough for me to create the time I need to work on it while staying sane.  Fortunately, I am very close to done.  Working on plain old Java webapps suddenly seems like the farthest thing from my mind, but it's good to know that I can do it in a pinch.

I no longer technically work for ALTERthought.  The work I did with a new client that I was assigned to proved to be fruitful enough that we've partnered together on a new venture.  As such, my contract has been assigned.  Or something.  I'm vague on the details, but my paycheck is coming from a new place.

The new venture is called Canal Street Capital (don't bother, we don't have a website yet).  Our goal is to create a hedge fund.  I don't want to get too far into the details of what I'm doing before we get input from the law team, since we're talking about real money now.  It's an extremely exciting project-- one that uses almost everything I've learned either formally at Rice or informally on my own.  I hope to be able to provide more details soon.
