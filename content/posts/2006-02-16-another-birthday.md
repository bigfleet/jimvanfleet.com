Megan got me [XM Radio](http://www.xmradio.com/) for my car and I've really been enjoying that.  It didn't take long!  We also spotted a sale on the boom box unit at a going-out-of-business sale at a Sam Goody franchise, and that will be very useful for work around the house without having to pay for a second unit monthly.

XM Radio is sort of like cable for your radio, for those who aren't familiar with it.  I listened to a song called "Hank Williams, You Wrote My Life", followed shortly by a song from Broken Social Scene.  (On another channel, of course.)

My folks also got me a new oven, which is a lot less sexy, but also a lot more useful, when it all comes down to it.

I haven't really made any goals for the coming year.  I did that for year #26, but they didn't really seem to match with what I thought was the right thing to do at the time.  I'm not sure if it's my goals or my attitude that need adjusting!
