PURITY: 38% sex, 15% substance, 50% moral [*36% total*]

*Well done!*  The higher your scores, the more "pure" you are. The lower, the more you've experienced.

This test was about done deeds, so your numbers will never climb. [It's interesting to think they all started at 100%.] But will your purity continue to fall?  Will you *OUTGROW* or will you *OUTDO* your past experiences? It's up to you.


* Don't *date* anyone if your *moral* purities differ by more than *30%*.
* Don't *run a business* with anyone if your *substance* purities differ by more than *40%*.
* Do *be friends* with someone who has less than 1/2 your *sex* purity. You'll enjoy their colorful company.

Note: as for the "TOTAL" purity value &#8211; that's a weighted combination of your scores, indicating what a typical purity test might say about you. 

How you compared to other people _your age and gender_:

You scored higher than *4%* on *substance*
You scored higher than *29%* on *sex*
You scored higher than *24%* on *moral*
You scored higher than *17%* on *<span class="caps">TOTAL</span>*
