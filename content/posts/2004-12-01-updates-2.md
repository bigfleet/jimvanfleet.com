* I still don't have a job.  Amentra balked at my request not to travel.  Would have been nice to have that job.
* I hope beyond hope that a check from Chuck is at my house and that I'll be sending off the laptop very soon now.
* I'm preparing to pass a Java Certified Programmer exam.  I did pass the mock exam I took, but I want to study some of the topics a bit more before I take the actual test.  Hopefully it'll help me find this job.
* Things are looking better for me getting down to East Tennessee at the first part of the year.  That'd be a good trip.  I'd like to see Ashley and Jay and all my _um_ dead friend's relatives.  Meep.
* Man, am I poor.  Still got my bills paid, though!
