First, I've obviously upgraded to a new theme.  Hopefully your collective memory of the unfortunate notepad theme will now be duly erased.

Second, I've transfered the account that I run the blog off of at <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a>.  Service may be interrupted at some point as the <span class="caps">DNS</span> records update, although I have to admit, I don't have a full mental model of what to expect during that process.

Anyway, I'll try to be on top of that when or if that happens.
