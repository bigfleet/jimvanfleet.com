Over Memorial Day, Megan and I visited Long Island for her brother's wedding.  Both the rehearsal dinner and the ceremony were very beautiful.  The bride, groom, and Megan were all looking particularly lovely as well.  Even I managed not to look repulsive.  I did have a lot of fun at both events and am glad I was able to go.

I thought it was pretty funny to see that Long Island apparently considers the rest of New York state a bit like Texas views the rest of the country.  Sure, there's a formal relationship, but they are pretty much doing their own thing.

I managed to get a little rest over the weekend, but not much.  Relationship winds were somewhat blustery among the bride and groom's families, but nothing too serious.  Still I feel I was very fortunate to be in attendance.
