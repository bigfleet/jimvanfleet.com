It's not my rant, but it is funny.  Neal Stephenson, the author of Cryptonomicon (among others), whipped up this impressive work called [In The Beginning, There Was The Command Line](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs81n/command.txt).  I don't know why he did it, but it's easier to read than you might expect for a piece on the history of operating systems.  You'll know more than you did when you started, probably.


I might eventually write an expanded entry with my own comments on the work, but I was reminded of this piece's existence this morning and wanted to get it up.
