When I was taking my Human Factors course at Rice, I was the "tech rat" that produced a working application following a set of usability guidelines.  I've wanted to get my hands on those guidelines again ever since, and now, there's the <span class="caps">MIT</span> IS&T: Usability Guidelines for reference.  This is even better than the one we had.

It's important to keep the end user in mind, and this list is an important set of disciplines to adhere to.

(ed. note: I am leaving the text intact to convey the timely sentiment.  The resources are long gone.  The spiritual successor to the resource is at [usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/sites/default/files/documents/guidelines_book.pdf).)
