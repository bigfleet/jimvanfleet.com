There's been some things happening this week.

* I did a little personal project in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), which is really killer.  The project is still very _secret_, so no fair asking.
* I did not-too-well in the first basketball game I was in this past week.  0-2 from the floor, but I did get some rebounds.
* Lifting weights is going swimmingly.  Ricky, I'll get around to posting what my trainer had to say about it at some point.
* Speaking of Ricky, I just bought a plane ticket to attend his wedding.  Got my hotel, too.  I'm staying at the La Quinta downtown.
* I'm getting ready to cook breakfast.  When I eat at the great breakfast place around the corner, their bacon is way better than their sausage-- but I love sausage!
* I gave a nifty presentation on Java at work.  I'm not quite certain what they are going to ask me to do anymore.  Now *that's* an odd situation.  So right now, I'm working but taking it easy.
