The project is undergoing its first customer demo as we speak.  It's in Great Britian, which means I'm up at 4 in the morning!  I'm getting bored sitting here waiting for a problem, and I'm certainly not up for any taxing mental activity.

As for what I'm working on these days, it's an introduction to <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> using some techniques and tools from other popular open source projects.  It will also include a framework for unit testing a <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> application thoroughly.  It's coming together pretty well, so far.  It appears that I may have to put it on the shelf for another week or so to handle some customer requests, but that's the price we pay...
