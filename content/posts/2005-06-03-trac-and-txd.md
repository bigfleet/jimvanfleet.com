I have recently fallen in love with [Trac](http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/), as it combines a Wiki, an excellent bug tracker, some rudimentary project controls, and a source code browser into one package.

I already fell in love with [TextDrive](https://textdrive.com/) where my *VCII* status gives me shared hosting for life.

Now with Running Trac on TxD, I can combine the two.  You should check them both out!
