I managed to get two items crossed off my blog to-do list:  I got sidebar elements encapsulated (less than one line of code) and then the <span class="caps">CSS</span> and images ready.

<span class="caps">CSS</span> is one of the weaker parts of my portfolio, but at least I have something I can call my own.  As I learn more and more about <span class="caps">CSS</span>, I'm sure I can bring my theme up to par.
