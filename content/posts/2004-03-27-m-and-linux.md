Here's a story about the gigantic [Microsoft fine](https://www.dw.com/en/microsoft-slapped-with-biggest-fine-in-eu-history/a-1149932) and what it means to Linux.  One thing to remember as you read these stories;  Linux is free.  It has no shareholders, really.  It has no costs.  It's not going anywhere but up.  Ground it gains in the battle it will never lose, because it is *free*, and people like that.
