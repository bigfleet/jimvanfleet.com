My longest absence ever from the blog, more than a month and a half.  I can only say that I was needed elsewhere.  I've been reminded recently about how I used to post about the smallest things, like the fact that it's so much easier to appreciate Lennox Lewis's career now that the heavyweight division is horrible.  But these thoughts wither and die as I'm on my way from one place to another and I just haven't gotten them up.  Fortunately, or unfortunately, no one cares anyway.  But, anyway, at least the drought is over now.
