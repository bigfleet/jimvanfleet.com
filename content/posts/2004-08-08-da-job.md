I've technically been self-employed for quite some time now, so I'm not technically changing employers;  I still appear to be myself.

I'll be spending most of my time contracting with a fellow who runs a [local IT shop](http://www.ideaweavers.com) that sells a particular web application to business clients in the area.  To customers, this application is great.  It performs many, many useful tasks.  To a technical person in charge of working with the application, it needs a lot of work!  Since I happen to *be* a technical person, I see my job as making the code tight enough you could bounce a quarter off of it, then getting rich.

Taking the contract means significantly fewer responsibilities and significantly more pay.  This is always a good trade!

I'll be sticking with my current contract for a few weeks still.  It's not in me to leave anyone high and dry, much less someone who's paid my salary for months.  The project has been a success, which is kind of amazing in its own right.  I came in on-time and within budget, which apparently one in ten IT projects do.

I can't even see what the coming week will bring, but I know it will be alright.  I haven't been this excited since Erin was still with me.
