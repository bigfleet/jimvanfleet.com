The past 72 hours have been pretty crazy.  Here's the fallout.



* I was up until about 5:30 AM on Wednesday night making sure that the set of reports that my project generated for its second pilot group were as good as possible.
* Thursday afternoon, we find a problem.  I have about six hours to regenerate all the reports, get them printed out, and get them FedExed to Ithaca, NY.  That's where [Cornell](http://www.cornell.edu) is, for everyone who's not Dan.
* My A/C adaptor quit working, and my laptop quickly ran out of batteries, so I spent the day driving and calling around Richmond to find a replacement.  Also, my cell phone mysteriously stopped working.
* I didn't get them out on Thursday, so I spent Friday doing the same thing, with the knowledge that we were all out of chances.
* It seems to have worked.  Yesterday went off without too much of a hitch, and now the reports are on the FedEx truck for delivery.

Did you know that FedEx bought Kinko's?  Or something along those lines?  Very interesting.  Certainly helped me out!
