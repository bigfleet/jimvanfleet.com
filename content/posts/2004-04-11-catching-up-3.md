* I'm nearing completion on my project.  It's my hope that in the next couple of weeks I can really begin a personal life, including talking to you guys more.  Of course, there's really not been too much to talk about-- I'm watching movies and sports, thrilling, huh?
* I'm going to another conference in Reston next month.  I'm spending almost a grand to learn stuff.  Weird, huh?  I don't even doubt that I'll get my money's worth from it, though.
* _Matchstick Men_ is a good movie.
* _Deadwood_ is a good series.
