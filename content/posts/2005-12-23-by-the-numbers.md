The joys of holiday technical support!

|  |         |
|:-:|--------|
| 1  | Number of flawless hard drive replacements on the Dimension 4100       |
| 3  | Trips to Dell's support site for drivers and manuals        |
| 21  |  Viruses detected on the old hard drive      |
| 15  | Different kinds of viruses |
| >20 | installations of America Online, ranging from the _5.x_ to the _9.x_ series. |
| 0 | Ethernet cards installed in the computer |
| ~750 | Doo-wop songs saved from the bit bucket |
| 3,000 songs x 4MB song x 1 Min per MB / 24 hours per day | Someone is either very committed or is finding people to bootleg <span class="caps">MP3</span> cd's from. |
| About 12 | Off-color pictures saved |

But the most important number is

*2:* Non-administrator accounts created

*Wait!*  I mean--

*2:* Happy future in-laws.

Happy holidays, everybody.  I have some good posts left this year, so don't hold this one against me.
