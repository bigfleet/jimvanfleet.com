Megan and I returned this afternoon from a trip to DC to see [Massive Attack](http://www.massiveattack.co.uk/) at the [9:30 Club](http://www.930.com).  My good friend Bill was able to come as well.  We were both pretty psyched that they were even playing in the general area, since they don't tour stateside that often.  The show totally ruled.  No surprise there.

It was even better than that, because of our stay at the Hotel Helix and our dinner at Duke's Lounge.  Duke's has an excellent Cosmopolitan, and we are planning big things for the Hotel Helix.  My sister absolutely has to see it.  It's so incredibly her style I can't believe it.

There.  I finally posted about something more or less when it happened.  I still behind, but whatever.</p>
