I'll be processing the notes, and sharing the results here, as time goes on.  For now, I'll give the recollections I have.

* [Dave Thomas](https://pragdave.me/) is a great speaker.  Cobbie told me to go see all of his talks, and I should have paid attention.  The one I did attend, Pragmatic Mock Objects, gave me a tool that will soon become a cornerstone of my entire testing framework.
* Stu Halloway at Relevance, <span class="caps">LLC</span> is very effective as a speaker, and had some great advanced programming techniques. 
* Bruce Tate of J2Life and Rick Hightower of ArcMind both gave very interesting talks.  I got quite a bit out of the more in-depth introduction to [Spring](https://spring.io/), which they both like, and the <span class="caps">TDD</span> for the Web session that Rick did.
* [Hotwire](http://www.hotwire.com/) worked great for me; consider it recommended
