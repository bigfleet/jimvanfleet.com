> But, to speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who call 
themselves no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government, but at once
a better government. Let every man make known what kind of government would command
his respect, and that will be one step toward obtaining it.

[Henry David Thoreau](http://thoreau.eserver.org/civil1.html)

This quote is over 160 years old. Think about it.
