I've accepted an offer to work at [Alterthought](http://www.alterthought.com/) in Richmond, VA about 300 yards from where I previously worked.  I'll be working on Java web development, as usual.

I was really excited to hear that they use the same major frameworks and <span class="caps">IDE</span> as I do (WebWork, Spring, Hibernate, and Eclipse respectively.)  That means I should be able to jump right in and help, more or less.  I believe that Alterthought will be a great help to me in my personal growth, as well as enabling me to contribute back to the open-source community.

More as it develops, dear readers!
