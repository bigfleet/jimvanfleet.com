I've had a bit of an event happen at IdeaWeavers, where I was working with my friend Bill.  He was possibly facing cash flow issues, the consequences of which would have been dire.  We worked together to help him find a way to keep his business and keep his rent paid.  It all worked out, but one of the results was that I needed to find my own work.

So I posted my resume on Monster and sent it around via e-mail yesterday, and now I'm headed out on an interview with [Amentra](http://www.amentra.com) which, at this very second, you know about as much as I do about.

I'm looking forward to the interview.  Sounds like it's a good match for me.

Look at how much can change so quickly!  What a month the past few have been.
