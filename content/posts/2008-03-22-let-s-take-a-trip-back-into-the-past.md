I saw [Built To Spill](http://www.builttospill.com/") at the [Neighborhood Theater](http://www.neighborhoodtheatre.com/) here in Charlotte earlier this month.  I almost didn't go because I felt a little low energy, but I couldn't be happier that I did.  It was an excellent introduction to live music here in Charlotte.  They closed their set with [Carry The Zero](http://www.last.fm/music/Built+to+Spill/_/Carry+the+Zero), a song that I named one of my favorite mix CD's after-- ten years ago!  Unreal.

Also interesting was the discovery that rock and roll is still alive-- and it looks like my dad!  I can't find any pictures of what [Doug Martsch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Martsch) is looking like these days, but he's not going to be on TRL anytime soon.  I bought a cigarette off a beggar for 75 cents.  I'm not sure whether to feel depressed or whether I was actually showing him the way up and out of poverty.


Last night, Megan and I went to see [Greg Brown](http://www.gregbrown.org/) at the [McGlohon Theater](https://charlottecultureguide.com/organization.php?id=78</a>.  An [old friend](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=609730463) got me into Greg Brown  *more* than ten years ago. I saw him in Knoxville's Laurel Theater ages ago.  This show was a lot more bluesy, but he was still personable and so relaxed.  He broke a string, and retuned the guitar and finished the song with more aplomb than some other musicians do a whole solo.

I was amazed at how intimate the venue was.  Incredible.  Megan got very distracted at some of our fellow concertgoers-- you must learn to tune them out, grasshopper!  We took the light rail into uptown to try that out.  It will be worth it for ballgames, but overall I thought the most impressive part of the light rail was getting a fuller view of Charlotte itself.  There is definitely a lot to like about this city.  I'm feeling very at home.
