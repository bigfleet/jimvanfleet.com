So, even though my boss said he'd try not to throw me into the deep end-- there I am!  I've been requested by the QA/QC (that's Quality Assurance/Quality Control for the non-droids out there) department head to come take a look at their processes.  So now I'm glad I read that consulting book!


In other job news, the miscellaneous web tasks have been no problem.  Work on the web application framework is progressing well, and when I'm finished, I should have something pretty nice to offer the public.  Yeah, sure, you probably could care less, but I've spent almost a week on it now, so somebody will appreciate the Google search that turns that up!


But I still love the job.  There's so much I'm learning so quickly--  I'll make my mistakes and take my bumps, but this is a time in my life I can do something like this.  Just work and work like crazy.
