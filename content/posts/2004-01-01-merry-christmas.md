The request for the wardrobe came about when I discovered that I had two shirts that were the same.  Exactly the same.  And I had been wearing them for months, without even realizing.  Unforgivable!  "When did this happen?" I thought.  Booney would never have let something like that happen on her watch.

Anyway, the new threads are mostly from [Eddie Bauer](https://www.eddiebauer.com/).  I've gotten many clothes from them over the years, mostly because they have a wide selection in Tall.  (Also, when did Structure turn into Express Men and start to suck?  How come they didn't run it by me?)

Anyway, the content is mostly long-sleeve woven button-downs, suitable for dress or casual.  It reminds me of Faykus's wardrobe, only maybe with more stripes-- and I don't think I've seen him wear any sweaters.  Not that any of you have seen *me* wear more than one or two maybe.  But now I have some very nice ones that are actually appealing to wear.  I actually like the idea, since apparently the idea of what a "sweater" is has changed since I was eight, and had to wear them to church.  They're a lot thinner!

A lot of accessories, too.  New pairs of comfortable dress shoes, gloves, sunglasses, etc.  I can appreciate anything that makes me feel a bit like I'm a new person.  Even though it's plainly obvious to everyone, I sometimes forget.

The knives are from J.A. Henckel.  Erin's mom took back the ones she bought for her-- who could blame her!  I survived my semester in the one-bedroom down on Brompton with just a utility knife.  Have you ever cut bread with a utility knife?  Not pretty.  So anyway, score that one for the new place-- whenever *that* happens.  We're having enough problems just getting the basement finished.

Christmas Eve netted me some neat books, including some which you'll sure to see reviewed here shortly.  Free time has been a lot harder to come by, lately.  I did get some <span class="caps">DVD</span>'s as well, like Simpson's Third Season (classic) and Family Guy third season (I didn't even have the first two-- what gives, Ib?)

That's all for this post!
