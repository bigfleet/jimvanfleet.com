I'd like to introduce you to [Blanket](http://github.com/bigfleet/blanket/tree/master), a library designed to make automated, remote backup easier.  I've had to set up automated backup before, and I wrote this package to make it more enjoyable for myself and others.  I was also experimenting with a lot of new technologies and techniques, which makes it even more rewarding that the end product ending being a preliminary success.


An [introduction to Blanket](http://github.com/bigfleet/blanket/wikis/quickstart) is available.  There's also the [blanket project on RubyForge](http://rubyforge.org/projects/blanket/) which means that I also have my first Gem in the wild.


Install it, kick it around, and if you like what you see, take a look at [the development road map](http://github.com/bigfleet/blanket/wikis/todo) and see if you'd like to get involved.  I have some GitHub invites if you need them, so please contact me if that's an issue.
