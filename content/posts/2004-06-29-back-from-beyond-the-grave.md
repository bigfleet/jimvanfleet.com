Yeah, I'm still kicking it.


The move is over, more or less.  I now live in [The Fan](http://www.fandistrict.org/) in Richmond, VA.  It's really very nice.  There's folks of all ages, but everybody's personable.  I live less then two blocks from three different restaurants, all of them good.  All of them are also bars.  It's that kind of place.


I live in a very old house, it'll be 100 next year.  That has its own quirks, but mostly it's a nice change of pace from the sterile Brompton Court apartments.  I am the closest to a laundry room I've ever been.  No dishwasher, though.  With the amount of cooking I do, however, that's not a huge sacrifice.


My project has been running for almost a week with no real hiccups.  That's pretty gratifying.


My friendship with Elizabeth is turning into something a little new for me, not that it's any of your business.  ;-)


I'm getting ready to visit Brady this weekend down in South Carolina.  That's going to be a lot of fun.


Mostly, I'm hoping to start writing more frequently.  Not the first time you've heard me say that, though, right?
