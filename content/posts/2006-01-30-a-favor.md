No matter how you know me or have come to find this page, I would appreciate it if you would take [this brief survey](http://friends.cisv.org/survey/47512444/index.cfm).  It's about an organization for which I care very deeply, [CISV](http://www.cisv.org/).

<span class="caps">CISV</span> is a wonderful organization with a clear mission: to create peace through the education of children aged 11 to 18 by exposing them to different cultures in neutral environment and caring guidance from adult leaders.  I have been a part of this organization since I was 11 years old.  The world needs our organization more than ever before, and I'd appreciate it if you could help us get a better idea of how to present our organization to those that have never heard of us before.
