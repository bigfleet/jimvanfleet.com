I'd been thinking of things to say for months.  I was lucky enough to see him more in the past two months than I had in the past five or six years.  There were things like him getting out of the hospital and cooking me dinner that I thought would work its way into some kind of metaphor for how he treated his illness throughout his life, but it didn't.  When it was time to speak at the viewing, all I could think about was my friend and everything we had been through, and I just couldn't... say... anything.....

We were a part of each other's happy stories.  He sent me this wonderful e-mail reminding me of the ones he remembered, and I did the same for him.  It turns out that it was just after he had learned that the cancer was back.

I'm so tired of this.  Can't this year end already?
