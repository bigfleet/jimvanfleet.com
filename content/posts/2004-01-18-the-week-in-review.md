I'm so sleepy.


It wasn't as good of a week.  I'll be glad when the first consulting gig is over, so I can roll off those kind of projects for awhile.  There's some stops closer to the computing base camp I need to cover first.


I got to the gym four days out of five.  I got by in touch with Elizabeth, my one VA friend.  Pretty much a grinding week, hope to have more fun next time.
