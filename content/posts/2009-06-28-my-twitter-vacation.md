It's been bizarre to see Twitter become so popular so quickly.  I love its versatility and how it's helped me do a lot of different things in my professional and personal life.  For no particular reason I decided to take a month off to see what I missed, what I didn't, and anything else I might have noticed.

## Things I missed.


* Tweeting my frustrations with "the way things are"</li>
* Questions my followers could help me with</li>
* Talking about what I was listening to</li>
* Complimenting <a href="http://twitter.com/blairblends">@blairblends</a> on his fab new avatar</li>
* Announcements of big achievements (I had two!)</li>
* Marking tweets as favorites.</li>
* Reading tweets from friends</li>
* Reading tweets from people who can teach me something I want to learn.</li>

## Things I did not miss

* *The noise*
* Being among the first to know about scandals or deaths
* Green avatars
* Reading tweets from people I am trying to keep tabs on

## What Now?

I think it's time to focus a little bit more on the people who I like the most on Twitter.  This is going to mean unfollowing a lot of people I have been following for a long time.  It's going to mean unfollowing some people who follow me.  I'm OK with that.

I also felt like I had more creative energy for bigger projects.  I was surprised how much not tweeting meant for my "blog ideas" lists or ideas for my book.  I think I'll be moving toward just the occasional tweet during the day and doing most of my tweeting at night.

But overall, I found it an interesting experiment.  If Twitter is a big deal for you (and I imagine some of you reading this might fit that description), I recommend taking some time off and seeing what you learn.
