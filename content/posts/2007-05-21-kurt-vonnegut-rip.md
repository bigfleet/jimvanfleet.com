I haven't started reading his books because of his death, but I read _Cat's Cradle_ during my sister's graduation.  I fell in love all over again with his content and his style.  I hadn't read any of his work since I was in middle school (_Harrison Bergeron_, with the predictable effects).</p>


I've read the first few pages of _Slaughterhouse Five_, and I am quite certain that he will become one of my favorite authors.  At the same time, it becomes clear to me that I should begin some library transfer from my father.
