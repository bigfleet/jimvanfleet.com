First, my own Madden exploits.  I've decided that I'm going to be a Houston Texans fan.  They have made some great personnel decisions and are putting together a team that I really like.  So it was a natural thing to pick them for my franchise in Madden.

My first campaign ended at 10-6 and a playoff berth after winning my division. Baltimore came into my house and beat me, but I considered it a success.   I royally messed up the off-season, though, so I considered it a good training run.

A couple of days ago, I finished my second campaign.  This one was 18-1 and a Super Bowl championship.  Stacey Mack was the <span class="caps">MVP</span> of the league with over 2,000 yards and 28 rushing touchdowns.  David Carr, Billy Miller and three lineman went to the Pro Bowl on the offensive end.  Aaron Glenn scored seven defensive touchdowns off interception returns.  He and Marcus Coleman went and started at cornerback.  In the off-season, I signed Warren Sapp.  Sapp a Texan!  Only in Madden.  I haven't had this much fun playing Madden since the first one for the Super Nintendo.  The patented Randall Cunningham -> Shotgun -> Hail Mary combined with a bootleg run for 50 or 25 yards depending on if they were playing man or zone.  Now Madden has 3600 plays or so.


Also, in our new <span class="caps">NFL</span> season, it looks like somebody's in owner mode.  How else would you explain Peyton's line in the New Orleans game and Jamal's line against Cincinnati?  I just put it together-- both graduated from Tennessee.  But the new <span class="caps">NFL</span> seasons looks intriguing.  Can't wait to see what things look like in week 8.


Peyton singlehandedly resurrected my fantasy chances this year.  I lost my first two games, posting some of the worst scores I've ever put up in week one.  I was standing on the verge of 1-3 when Peyton outscored many teams singlehanded.  And of course, I cut Ashley Lelie and Drew Bennet before they could get going.  Stupid me!
