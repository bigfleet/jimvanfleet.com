What a week!

By the end of Thursday the 23rd, all of the necessary elements to complete my 360 feedback project were in place.  I'll just be straightening up until the 1st.  Next week of work is my lightest in months.

The project _knock on wood_ looks to me like it will be a total success.  We've been kicking the tires on the remote server for weeks now.  I feel like I hit both date targets, even though I was lucky.  We were under budget.  Now all we need is a successful session or two, and that'll be that.

Also, I put down a deposit on a new place yesterday.  I'm moving out.  It's an absolutely huge 2 bedroom in Richmond's "Fan" area.  It's the French Quarter, but more watered down and not French.  If I knew more about the Montrose area in Houston, I might say it was similar to that.  2,200 sq. ft for $850 a month is nice.  The house is almost a hundred years old.  Corner stores, markets, restaurants, and bars are all within walking distance.

It'll be the most alone I've been in seven years.  We'll have to see how that goes.

Well, what do you think of that?  I'll be in Richmond till 2005.  Let's hope it's an improvement.
