I've been quite busy with the actual product I've put out.  Since I last posted (in no particular order)...</p>


* The site has seen its two pilot groups debut almost without a hitch.
* During development, I was assuming that we would have a potential concurrent user base in the hundreds.  It now is clear that the number is in the thousands.  This has led to a large amount of hard work for me that I don't enjoy in a short amount of time.
* The needs of the project in general are now larger than I can assuredly handle.  I've had to accept this and just be thankful that I still have a job each morning.
* I've been offered a new job in principle.  The fellow who offered it to me will be back this week to discuss specifics.  Think: more pay, less work.
* My current boss is in town this week to discuss where we are right now, and where we can be in the future.  Timing with above is intriguing.
* I've learned it is a possibility that the project could fail and it wouldn't necessarily be my fault;  one needs an entire team of non-developers for the project to be a success.  One good developer isn't enough.
