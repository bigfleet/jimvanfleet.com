Last Friday, I was offered a position at Dominion Medical.  I accepted!

It's a six month contract to hire position that I found through Robert Half Technology.  The task is to *eventually* do web application development.  For now, the job is to produce a "proof of concept" web application that's very limited in scope.  This will illuminate the kind of work that will be involved in the full project.

If I get hired at the end of six months, I'm likely to end up with some sort of title like "Director of Web Application Development" at a Fortune 1000 company.  It's a huge opportunity, and I'm very excited about the possibilities.

Bill took it well, and I'm finishing up one element that I have nearly completed.  After that, I'll be checking in with him to see if there's bits and pieces that I can do for him.
