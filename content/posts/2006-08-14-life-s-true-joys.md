Calling people is taking absolutely *forever*, so for those who haven't heard yet. Megan and I got engaged.  It's getting to be so long since it happened that you'll think I don't care about you.

It was on the first day of our beach vacation.  I hadn't been planning it, but we were walking along the beach, and some other folks were setting off fireworks.  I had been thinking for ages about all the things I wanted to do, like make sure that she'd love the location, and getting the perfect jewelry item.  I realized, though, that none of that mattered at all, really, and I should just ask her.  She said *yes!*

We haven't set a date yet, although it'll probably be fall of next year.  We've really just begun looking at locations, although Megan has apparently bought her dress already.
