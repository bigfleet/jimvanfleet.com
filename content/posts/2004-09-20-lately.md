* I stepped back up onto the 360 highwire to deliver a major change to the reports on a short deadline.
* I created a simple <span class="caps">HTML</span>+CSS website for the first time in years.  You can learn some interesting techniques at the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) and [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/) are both excellent reference material.  <span class="caps">CSS2</span> is probably the most wonderful thing to happen on the web <strong>since</strong> HTML.
* Doing a bit of work for [IdeaWeavers](http://www.ideaweavers.com) clients to keep the bills paid and the leaks plugged.
* Taking further steps on my project to tie together <span class="caps">SOFIA</span></a>, [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org) and [Spring](http://www.springframework.org).  The first unit tests covering page controller behavior have been written.  Soon, it'll be time to write an actually difficult test.
