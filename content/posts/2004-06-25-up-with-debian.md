Thanks to [this post](http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?s=&#38;threadid=197365&#38;highlight=usb keyboard) about <span class="caps">USB</span> support in Linux, I'm now running two boxes in my office.  One is Windows XP, the other is now a Debian Linux installation.

I've added the second box to help practice some of my build techniques without having to have the real remote server down.  Plus, it's extra geek points!

I've got some <span class="caps">NFJS</span> reviews in the can.  Look for them to be up in the next couple of days.  Right now I'm doing some customer support.
