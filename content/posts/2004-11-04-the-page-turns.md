* If you want to register at [OKCupid](http://www.okcupid.com), she's `petitebijou`.
* She's a very upbeat, very caring person.  She's been very patient with my mild neuroses.  I'd say our relationship is best described by the word "comfortable."
* We haven't been going out for very long.  I suppose that we would have started about a week after my last blog post.
* I think we're both pretty excited about having met each other.
* The only way I can stay sane is to take it one day at a time, and let things go in their own direction at their own pace.  So far, no problem.
* Leave a comment with tips for her on how to deal with me, if you like!  That'll be funny!
