I reached feature freeze on my first project today.  What a feeling!  Key stakeholder buy-in on Friday of last week, and now the doors are closed.  We launch the first week of June.

I'll be including more details about my project here soon.  For now, I've got to head to the Richmond Braves game that I won tickets to at the last Richmond JUG meeting.
