I'm doing the transition of employers this month, which means two jobs.  That's why I'm not getting much time to post.  Look for more in September.

In terms of my projects, I am moving along my integration of <span class="caps">SOFIA</span>, [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org), and [Spring](http://www.springframework.org).  I'm finishing up work on the persistence layer, then I'll be moving on to the front end construction.
