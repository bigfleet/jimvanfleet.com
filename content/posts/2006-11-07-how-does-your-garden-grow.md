So, I took a few pictures of the various sections a few weeks ago, and now it's up on the web.

I didn't go the flickr route except with a couple of them.  And I have a problem spending $30 on something that my linux tools do at least a decent job of automating.

I also don't have any captions on any of them, because, to be quite honest, I know the names of about a half-dozen of the plants.  I know Megan knows more.  Anyway, I talked a little bit about why [I love the garden so much](../2006-09-17-plants) already, and I need to get rolling today.
