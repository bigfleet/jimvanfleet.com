For those of you out there who are still single, or even if you aren't, [OK Cupid](ttp://www.okcupid.com) is attempting to pull one over on  Friendster.  It's already far superior as a dating site, and now they've added the [Six Degrees](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108149/) [of Separation](https://hbr.org/2003/02/the-science-behind-six-degrees) factor for participants.


So I'm inviting everyone to come open an account and let me add you as a real friend.  I guarantee that they are better then Friendster.
