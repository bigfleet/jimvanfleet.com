After seeing [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/) pop up on my del.icio.us  popular page, I went and checked it out.  I tried using it on my barrel of <span class="caps">MP3</span>'s that I had no hope of ever fully classifying, or really figuring out where they came from.  I was shocked, not only at how well the program worked, but how easy it was to use.  It even respects how I name files, and will handle that for me as well!

I still use [Tag & Rename](https://www.softpointer.com/tr.htm) to finish up with assigning a year, and getting the directory structure exactly how I like it, but MusicBrainz has already become an indespensible part of my <span class="caps">MP3</span> stack.

In short, if you have a lot of <span class="caps">MP3</span>'s, or you are an active downloader, please use a condom.

Wait!  No, I mean, give [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/) a try.
