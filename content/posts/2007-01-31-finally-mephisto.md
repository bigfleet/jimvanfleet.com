Those of you uninterested in geek talk can just skip this post entirely.

Several months after porting a theme to Mephisto, I finally had a chance to adopt it for myself.  I was getting incredibly behind on my blogging, mostly due to continued random Typo outages and the Typo trunk being unprepared to handle them combined with a sudden aversion to dealing with that particular problem.


Well, I just jumped in with both feet.  I'm going to be doing a lot of behind the scenes work on the blog, hopefully that'll just make it nicer to deal with over time.  I hope to be posting more frequently now.
