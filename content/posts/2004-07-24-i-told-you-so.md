Well, <a href="../2003-08-27-review-war-double-bill">as I predicted</a>, they&#8217;re remaking The Manchurian Candidate.   Now, a second prediction.  This one will blow blue whale, the largest mammal on earth.</p>

The central conceit has been changed from Soviet brainwashing to <i>(ready?)</i> <strong>Corporate America</strong> brainwashing.  That&#8217;s right, they don&#8217;t feel they have enough control, so they&#8217;re going to <strong>kill the President</strong>.  How ridiculous!</p>

At least Denzel could marginally fill in for Frank Sinatra, although watching Frank break out the chop-socky on the Oriental in the orginal was absolutely priceless.</p>
