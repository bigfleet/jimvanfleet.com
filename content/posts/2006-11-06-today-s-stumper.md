One of Megan's students asked her a question for her government survey: "Do you feel safer now than you did before 9/11?"

I have the hardest time even beginning to answer that question.  Is this supposed to be a referendum on Bush's performance?  A meditation on security?  An invitation to layman speculation about the potential of a terrorist attack on Richmond, Virginia and/or Houston, Texas?

Feel free to add your own impressions.
