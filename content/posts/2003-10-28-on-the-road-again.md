Last week, it was the <span class="caps">CISV</span> National Board Meeting.  It's the least I've had to do leaving an <span class="caps">NBM</span> since I was a JB president ten years ago.  This coming weekend, I'm headed to Knoxville!  I'll be checking in on Jess, and accompanying my sister, who'll be meeting her friends.  It'll be so welcome to be able to make the trip in one day, and I'm happy to make Ib's drive only a few hours instead of two full days.  I do like it behind the wheel!
