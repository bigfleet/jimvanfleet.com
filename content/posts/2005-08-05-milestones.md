I've been working hard for the past few months producing my first app with WebWork.  I just passed 50 revisions in my current SubVersion repository and 50 tickets in [Trac](http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/).  I've leared a good deal about [JasperReports](http://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/), as well.  I'm confident that as my skills increase, I'll be providing more data back to the blogosphere.

Also, watch this space, as I'm likely to bring my personal site, blog, and this blog together into the same structure.
