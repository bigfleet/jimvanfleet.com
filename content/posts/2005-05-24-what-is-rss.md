Well, I'm not going to tell you yet, but here is a collection of some of the sites I visit around the web.  A neat place to get information about me periodically, as even if I don't post here, I'll be doing something with del.icio.us (ed. note: now pinboard below.).

Gosh, I've got a lot to get out and on here.  _(sigh)_
