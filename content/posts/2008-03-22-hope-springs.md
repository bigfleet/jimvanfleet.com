As I write this, with the late evening games of Round 1 yet to conclude, I stand tied for first in my bracket competition.  Come on, buckets, I could use the spare dough!  I am officially worried by the Clemson Tigers at this second, however.  A Tiger beats a Wildcat every time, though, so I am sure they'll pull through.  I don't care how feisty that Wildcat is.

I'm happy to see the UT men's basketball team put together a good season, and I thought the game against Memphis was a classic.  I hope to see them do well, even though I picked them to get upset early.  That way I at least get something to be happy about either way.

I may not have football, but it's a good looking spring right now.
