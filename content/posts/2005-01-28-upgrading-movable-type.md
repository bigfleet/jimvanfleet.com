I've upgraded [MovableType](http://www.movabletype.com), the blogging software that I run, to the latest version, thanks to a not-too-thinly veiled threat from Dreamhost to *shut me down* if I didn't do so.

Why, you might ask?  Comment spam.  Ricky referred to it as "grafitti", which is wildly more preferable.

Anyway, comment spam is a fact of life now, so we have to live with it.  I'll be posting a follow-up here with how to register yourself as a commenter on MovableType systems at [TypeKey](http://www.typekey.com).  But I've already spent enough time on this today, so it'll have to wait.
