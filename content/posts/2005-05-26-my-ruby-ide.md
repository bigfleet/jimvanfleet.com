I've settled on using [jEdit with a plug-in](http://www.jedit.org/ruby/download/) for my Ruby coding.  I've found that having the core <span class="caps">API</span> handy may actually come out higher on the cost/benefit ratio that code completion.  I really don't even miss Ctrl+space.


I am working on one major project in Ruby involving a web application and one minor one involving my <span class="caps">MP3</span> collection.

*UPDATE*:  I have since changed gears and gone with Eclipse and <span class="caps">RDT</span>.  You can find a  [fabulous walkthrough for Eclipse and Ruby on Rails](http://www.napcs.com/howto/railsonwindows.html) at <span class="caps">NAPCS</span>.
