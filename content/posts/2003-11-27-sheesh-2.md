It's been three weeks since my last post.  Three weeks!  I don't know what's more sad-- the fact that it's been that long or the fact that there really hasn't been a development anywhere.  At least, one that's any of your business.

I am headed to New York tomorrow, though, and that should be fun.  More when I get back, and maybe I'll be able to drop some science from the road.
