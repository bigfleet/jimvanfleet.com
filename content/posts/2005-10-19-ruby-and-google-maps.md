I've finished a non-trivial [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) integration for one of my [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com/) apps.

No offense, but the Cartographer library has quite some way to go, but it was an excellent starting point.  I hope to be able to contribute some interesting functionality to it in the near-term future.
