There's been no music reviews.  For those that know me, you're probably wondering what the hell that's all about.  The answer is this:  I'm learning how to make it one of the cornerstones of my personal site.  This job is going to be the final piece for me.  Once I get a certain portion of it done, I'll be able to whip some applications out almost on a whim.  It stands on the brink of completion.

At any rate, I put in a big order for new rekkids at [Sandbox](https://sandboxautomatic.com/about.html) which is the source for good, underground hip-hop.  I promise to finally share some reviews, even if the big framework isn't in place yet.
