For me, this was the slowest day of the conference by design.  I was so exhausted, and my feet hurt so badly that I wondered if I would even make it to the keynote in the morning.  I did manage to get there without too much problem, and the Aleve that I brought came in extremely handy.


My day included:

* [Exploring Virtual Clusters for Rails Development and Deployment](../2007-06-21-railsconf-writeups-exploring-virtual-clusters-for-rails-development-and-deployment)
* [Memcaching Rails](../2007-06-21-railsconf-writeups-memcaching-rails)
* [The Dark Art of Developing Plugins](../2007-06-21-railsconf-writeups-the-dark-art-of-developing-plugins)
* A short brain break</li>
* *Open Mic Demo Session* which I was asked to leave because my presence established a fire hazard.  Whatever.


During the Memcaching session, I missed my own solitary mention "on the floor" in the Joyent Slingshot presentation when I was mentioned as having worked on porting an application to it.  I later got together with the person who was asking about it-- Luke Melia is a commiter on Tracks.


Jon, a friend of his, and I walked out to McMenamin's for dinner.  Jon didn't like the beer that I got (It was named Ruby!) but the meal was decent.  After that, we walked back to the hotel and called it a day.


We ended up seeing a [clip I had shown Jon at the start of the day](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2007/05/finish-her/) on Inside Edition.  Jon and I were both tickled because we are evil persons.
