I was watching the 2004 World Series of Poker last night, and they had a bio on [Joe Awada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Awada), a player born in Lebanon who emigrated here.

When he got to the states, he didn't have any money, and was touring with a circus doing shlep work.  All while he was working there, he practiced juggling.  Eventually, he signed a contract with another circus that got him to Vegas.

So you think, "Oh, wow, then he learns how to gamble and makes it big!"  Not quite.  He ends up being a dealer and then [developing a new style of poker](https://www.denexa.com/blog/3-5-7/).  Apparently, that gives him the bankroll to then compete and win.

Unreal!
