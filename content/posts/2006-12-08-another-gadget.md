It would be fair to say that I have left a trail of gadgets in my wake.  Soon, my current cell phone will join the pile, as I have acquired a "smart phone".  In fact, I'm using it to make this post!  I just had to prove to myself that it was possible, and if any if you have my old cell number, please let me know.  I will probably have to change it.
