My first patch to an open source project is to WebWork for the [execute and wait interceptor](https://code.google.com/archive/p/opensymphony-webwork-backup/source/default/commits?page=21).

Raise your hands if you had that in the office pool.

If/when the patch is accepted, I'll post my extension to the interceptor that will keep an open Hibernate session bound to the background process using Spring.
