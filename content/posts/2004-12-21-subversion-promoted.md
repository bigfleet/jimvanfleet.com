[Subversion](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/) has now cracked the starting line-up, replacing <span class="caps">CVS</span>.  The cygwin installation (along with the knowledge that Subversion is written to be a client and a server) is enough to get you set up with a local repository after following the simple instructions in the book.

As a devoted [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) user, I found it useful to go to the [Subclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/subclipse) update site.

From there, it was no problem at all to get set up!  When combined with the upcoming [Subversion book](https://pragprog.com/titles/pg_svn/pragmatic-guide-to-subversion/) from the [Pragmatic Programmers](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/), it looks like Subversion has now earned its stripes.</p>
