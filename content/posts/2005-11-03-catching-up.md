It's been awhile since the last substantive post, so I'll just dump as I can while I wait for Mom to get into the neighborhood for dinner.</p>

## CISV NBM

The [CISV](http://www.cisv.org/) board meeting went well.  I got the different work plans for my committee put together, and even a sniff from Venkat out in San Fran who wants to collaborate on a Rails project for the member database.  If he thinks I'm going to let him slip past on that, he's crazy!

Probably the best part of the <span class="caps">NBM</span> was the quality time I got to spend with my Dad.  He's in a funny state of mind after having his position eliminated at Capital One, but we talked about the world of possibilities out there, and how good his situation is-- you know, relatively.
	
My mom's grant proposal went through, so I'll be project manager on a Rails project that I'll only be peripherally involved with.  That'll be a plus.

## Work

In my own Rails work, I'm just continually impressed with the depth of the framework.  I've been working with it for a few months now, and I just got around to functional testing.  Not only is it a piece of cake, but it also tests *rendering the page itself* for you!  In essence, if you mess up something in your .rhtml file, your functional test will find that and bomb out.  Talk about minimizing surprises!
	
I was also impressed with how easy it was to throw in a mock object.  One piece of my code goes out to the Internet to fetch data, for which I had already amassed a large amount of offline example data.  A few lines of code and a few *require* statements means I can run those tests using the files I've already downloaded to my hard drive.  I still miss Hibernate, but Ruby and Rails sure have some tricks up their sleeves.

The new job is going well, and I would say that even if I didn't know that one of my three readers works there, too.  (Hi, [Ryan](http://www.ryandaigle.com!)  I had to abandon the dream of Linux on the desktop which Ryan will now excoriate me for in the comments.  I am just going to have to fool around with that on my own.  I'm back on Windows and will be ready to start kicking butt tomorrow.

## Personal

I've been feeling under the weather recently, but I'm trying to stay up above it.
	
The Richmond <span class="caps">RING</span> had it's first Cashflow game on Tuesday evening.  The game was over in less than an hour&#8212;the most extraordinary performance I've seen yet.  It was a smash hit with the group, so that will turn into a regular engagement.
	
The album review will return this week.  Maybe I should just cut the crap and make it understood that I'll have one out every two weeks.
	
I finished [Trigun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigun) last night-- after converting all my downloads to <span class="caps">MPEG2</span> and transferring them to my TiVo-- and I would have preferred it to be a piece of crap right from the start.  That way, I would have felt satisfied that I hadn't missed anything.  As is, the tone totally disagreed with me, there are not nearly enough _Ninja Scroll_ type moments with the Gung Ho Guns.  The main character makes Hilary Clinton look like Newt Gingrich (or Mother Teresa look like Christopher Hitchens?).  Anyway, I give the thing a straight C.  Watch something else.
