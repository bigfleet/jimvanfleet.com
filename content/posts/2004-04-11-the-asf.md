Yesterday, I was talking to my dad, who works in communication for an IT department, but has no technical training.  I mentioned [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/), and he asked me, "Why would anyone give it away?"

I know the original codebase was a gift from Sun, and I can understand why they would want to give it away: to get people writing in Java.  But I was less sure about why [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) would want to.

Fortunately, on the [Apache News](https://news.apache.org/) blog, they recently posted [How the <span class="caps">ASF</span> works! &#8211; The Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/foundation/how-it-works/).

In short, they want to give away high quality software.  It&#8217;s their philosophy.  Who are we to argue?
