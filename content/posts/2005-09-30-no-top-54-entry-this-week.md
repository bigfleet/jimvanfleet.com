Apologies for being too tied up to get a review out this week.  I had a good excuse, I promise.

In exchange, I'll mention what I'm listening to these days.

[Iron And Wine](https://ironandwine.com/): {{<amzn asin=gkiweqd title="Our Endless Numbered Days">}}

'Passing Afternoon' is an absolutely gorgeous song.  Kudos to Megan's friend Marta for making the recommendation that broke the camel's back.

[Antony And The Johnsons](https://www.anohni.com/): {{<amzn asin=b7pl6d8 title="I Am A Bird Now">}}

Courtesy of [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/) they may be snotty, but they do like good music.  This record is quite unlike anything I've ever heard, but I like it.

That's all for now!
