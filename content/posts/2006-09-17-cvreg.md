The Central Virginia Ruby Enthusiasts' Group is up and running!

I've certainly been part of many non-profit groups, but I have never really started one.  I couldn't be more excited to see how this all turns out.  We've got a great group of people already coming to the meeting, and we just recently got our website up with more details.

If you're reading my blog for that sort of thing, go check it out!  There may be some interesting content there for you eventually.
