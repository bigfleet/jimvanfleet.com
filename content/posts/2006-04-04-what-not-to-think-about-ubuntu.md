"Well, they say they want another few weeks to polish the release for commercial support.  Surely it's OK for me to go ahead and pin myself to dapper and upgrade my distribution..."

I'm still recovering.

I'm no longer running FreeBSD at all, nor do I even have a Windows partition (although I do wish I could find my disc so that I can install XP in my VMWare-- that is, when I get my OS back into a reasonable state).  Ubuntu is really fantastic, but it can make a neophyte overconfident very easily.
