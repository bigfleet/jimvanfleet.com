Here at work, some of our legacy code has the problem of primitive <span class="inlineCode">double</span> and <span class="inlineCode">float</span> primitives turning into scientific notation when they are concatenated to a String.  Hence, a <span class="caps">SQL</span> statement ends up trying to use numbers with letters in them, and that's not going to work.

The solution is to use your friend the `java.text.NumberFormat` class.  After using the `setGroupingUsed(boolean)` and the `setMaximumIntegerDigits(int)` methods, my problems were over.

After I combed through all the code, bumping my way into places it was used.  See the next quickie.
