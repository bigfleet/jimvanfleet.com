Not Safari, the excellent <span class="caps">OS X</span> web browser, but the [O'Reilly Safari](https://learning.oreilly.com/)

It's really a NetFlix for the computer development world, only the content is fully searchable and available online.  I'm currently using my free preview, and it's so affordable, I really can't imagine any professional developer wanting to do without it.

Kudos to Cobbie Behren, who was nice enough to respond to a comment I made on [his blog](http://www.cobbie.com/blog) by beginning a very useful conversation!  Thanks Cobbie!
