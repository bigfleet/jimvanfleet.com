Normally this would be a linkroll post.  (Are you reading the linkroll?  Megan is!)  In this case, however, I'm going to make an exception.

Did you know that the United States [requires 2 billion dollars a day in foreign investment](https://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/01/chinas_reserve_.html)  to continue its current rate of capital consumption.  And that, for some reason, it's creditors are willing to put up with a relatively low interest rate *and* devaluation of the dollar on top?

I don't read all the economics blogs, but I can tell you, not even they know what this means.

What I will say is that if you are typically inspired by the behavior of the US, go get that stove on credit!
