I'm _very_ excited to be working on a new blog engine named [typo](http://typosphere.org/). For the first time, my blog is written in an language and platform that I can easily alter, so that the entire blog is a vehicle for expression instead of only the articles.

You'll also notice that I've integrated my two blogs together.  A later post will explain more about my motivations for this.

And stay tuned for new developments!  I have many in mind.
