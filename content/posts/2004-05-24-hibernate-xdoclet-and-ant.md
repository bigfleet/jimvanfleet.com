One of the things that I loathe about learning is the first step on the learning curve.  You go to the [XDoclet](https://xdoclet.sourceforge.net) site, and it seems like there are a zillion bits of information whizzing around in a thousand places.  How do you pick the one place to start?

I personally do not have the ability to start in more than one place.  Reap the benefits of my simple XDoclet + Hibernate Ant task.  Feel free to post a comment with any questions, but it should feel largely self documented.

Posting <span class="caps">XML</span> inside a blog is nearly impossible.  So these contents are lost to time.
