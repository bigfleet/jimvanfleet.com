### Our Party

Our Not-A-New-Year's bash went swimmingly!  Megan was a superstar in getting the place cleaned up and everything ready.  I pitched in with an assist on some things and helped keep her calm. Friends mixed and mingled and appeared to have a great time.

### New Year's Eve

We went to Fredericksburg for New Year's Eve.  We hung out with Marta, one of Megan's friends.  After having a nice dinner, we went back to Marta's place for cookies, South Park, sample questions from her brother's multi-state Bar exam prep book and some questionable champagne.

We walked to downtown Fredericksburg to watch the pear drop, but apparently the pear doesn't drop anymore;  they just have a laser light show and a ton of confetti.  I really enjoyed that part of the evening.  We spent the night back home in our bed.
