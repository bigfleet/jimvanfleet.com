I lost track of everybody who sent this.  @vinnie did it via DM, so he gets name checked, but feel free to leave a comment if you can provide evidence that you did it first.

1. I was a DJ in college at <a href="http://ktru.org/"><span class="caps">KTRU</span></a> for several years.   (I probably scanned that logo.)  My favorite story came during my first shift when I satisfied all my playlist requirements during the first hour of my shift, then played <a href="http://tinyurl.com/brainfreeze-album">Brainfreeze</a> in its entirety for the second hour.  I had one caller who claimed to be on their way to their probation hearing prior to returning to jail, but Brainfreeze still put a smile on their face.

2. My three cats are a Volunteer, a Longhorn, and a Tar Heel.

3. I have probably imbibed 100 cases of Cherry Coke Zero this year.

4. My middle name, Alanson (uh-LAN-son), has been in my family for three generations.  It is my father’s first name, and his father’s middle name.

5. I have been a part of a volunteer, non-profit organization called [CISV](http://www.cisv.org/) since I was 11 years old.  Its message is that children are basically the same the world around, but they grow up in different cultures.  I haven’t lived in the same city as a chapter since I was in high-school, but I have never stopped volunteering.

6. I am a recovering video game “addict”.  I think Megan may hate World Of Warcraft more than anything in the entire world.  I probably logged thousands of hours on Super Smash Brothers for the <span class="caps">N64</span>.  I once won a game of <span class="caps">NCAA</span> Basketball on the <span class="caps">SNES 132</span>-0 <strong>without using the reset button</strong>.  I found every exit on Super Mario World for each of the three saved game slots.  I am pretty sure I spent my entire freshman year playing Diablo and reading comic books.

7.  If I were to review my resume for college application at this point in my life, I doubt that I could remember 50% of the things on it, even though I know I must have done them.
