The Clientele is what happens when you mix Slowdive with the Olivia Tremor Control.  Very nice.

The Wolf Parade appears to be The Arcade Fire plus synthesizers, which I also like.

I just don't like the record from The Hold Steady.  Or the <span class="caps">LCD</span> Soundsystem.  So sue me.</p>

I am really digging the new Dangerdoom album.  <em>You know my rappin' is the #$^#$</em>!  I also like The Game's Documentary album, despite what you might have suspected.</p>
