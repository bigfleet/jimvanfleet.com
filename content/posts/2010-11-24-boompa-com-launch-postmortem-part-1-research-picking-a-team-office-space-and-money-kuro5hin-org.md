[Boompa.com Launch Postmortem, Part 1: Research, Picking a Team, Office Space and Money || kuro5hin.org](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2006/5/18/16204/1055): "Who's the better shot? Give them the gun.

> Ethan and I came up with the 'Zombie Team' test for figuring out whether or not someone is ready to work on an intense project, be it a start-up or otherwise. The test is this: If zombies suddenly sprung from the earth, could you trust the perspective team member to cover your back? Would they tell you if they got bit? Most importantly would you give them the team's only gun if you knew they were the better shot? If the answer is no to any of those questions you need to let them get eaten by the cubicle wasteland of corporate culture, because they aren't ready for this kind of work."

A great excerpt from a great post.  Go read it, seriously!  As the site no longer resolves, I wonder what became of it.
