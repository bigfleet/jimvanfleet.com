I just realized that I got the old Milton treatment.  I've been moved from the office I was working in, which was average, to the lab.  It's huge, but imagine a room that's no one's responsibility that a bunch of comps have access to.

* It's a total mess.  Trash on top of boxes on top of monitors
* I'll have to bring the minidisc with me every day.  There's about ten servers in here, so it's like someone sitting next to me, whistling.
* I've got about as much room as an airline passenger at my desk.

There's a typewriter in here, which is a fun throwback, but this is going to hamper my productivity today.  I think I'll go play a game or shop or something in protest.
