Adam Keys made a big splash last year with his presentation <a href="https://www.joeydevilla.com/2006/06/30/railsconf-2006-where-acdc-stravinsky-and-ruby-on-rails-meet/">AC/DC, Stravinsky, and Rails</a>.  Reading open-source code is one of my primary methods of learning, particularly languages in which I'm not that experienced.  So I was pretty pumped for this session.</p>


Despite Adam's entertaining style, I thought this presentation was pretty slow apart from the rapid-fire, laugh a second intro.
