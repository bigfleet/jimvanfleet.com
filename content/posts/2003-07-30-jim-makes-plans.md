Over the past couple of weekends, it's been hard for me to keep my spirits up.  I don't have very many friends left in town that I see all that often, and I'm really getting tired of hours and hours by myself in my apartment.

So this weekend, I'm headed up to Austin to stay with Eric Furbish, a friend of mine who's living there.  (I'd link to his homepage but it's *naked!*)  Eric, for goodness sakes, hide that directory listing with a web page.

At any rate, I'm sure I'll drop a line detailing what we'll get into.
