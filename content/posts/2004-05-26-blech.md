[This article](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1808659) about a Rice recruit being taken to strip clubs makes me sick.  I don't know what the atmosphere's like at Colorado or Missouri, but I do know what it's like at Rice.

Students who go there are expected to know better.  And I couldn't be more sure that the coach and AD are telling the truth when they say they knew nothing about it.

This guy went to a strip club, got kicked out, points the finger, and is now on <span class="caps">ESPN</span>.  Give me a break.
