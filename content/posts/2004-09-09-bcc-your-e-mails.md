I don't care how unit tested your code is, end users will complain that they didn't get the e-mail.  It's then your responsibilty to prove that the e-mail was sent.  You can't rely on your users choosing to configure their system to e-mail the designers.  Create some address whose sole resposibility is a mail archive and where delivery will be nearly guaranteed.
