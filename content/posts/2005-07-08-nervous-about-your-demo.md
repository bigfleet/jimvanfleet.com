Especially interesting is this.

> At Quantico Marine Air Base, in a special ceremony designed to win congressional support, an Osprey was supposed to roar over the airfield like a military jet, then dramatically drop to the tarmac in helicopter mode. But as members of Congress and government officials watched, the aircraft's right engine caught fire. The plane plunged 500 feet into the Potomac River, killing all seven marines aboard. The program was grounded for 11 months.
