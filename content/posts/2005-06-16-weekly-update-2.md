* Work Going Well
After spinning my wheels a bit at the first part of the week, I had a conference call with one of my users on Friday, and they loved what I'd been doing.  That always feels nice.
* Hit on by Quixtar
They used to be Amway.  I've pretty much dismissed their business model, which is like a chain letter plus salesman, but I want to at least talk to these guys to see how deep the realization runs within them.
* Craig's List bomb
Craig's List may be massively popular, but I don't know how well it works.  I've had a ton of leads for the apartment not even show up for the appointment.  I suppose that's life.  Onto the Style Weekly ad this week.
* Yard Sale
The yard sale went really well.  I got my media racks sold-- the first time I haven't owned any of them since 1997.  We still need to ditch some extra tables, though.
* Logo Bricked
The logo that I had made for the business venture is pretty much unusable.  I'm going to see if I can get what I'm looking for from an alternative source.
* Picked out paint colors
The paint colors for the new house, on the other hand, are looking * <span class="caps">GREAT</span>* .  I'll post them when I have a chance.
* Finalized dates of move-in
We had a chance to talk to the sellers, and everything is on schedule for them leaving early on the morning of the 24th to attend their own closing.  I'll be able to take possession later that day!
* Real Estate talks
I've had a chance to share some real estate knowledge with both a friend of a friend and a random stranger.  I really have to get a business card.  Stupid logo!  Why couldn't you have worked out?
