I upgraded the software that runs this blog in an effort to keep pages other than the main page up for a few hours at a time.  For those of you who may have visited recently and caught the very minimal look, that was because the stylesheets weren't working.

Commenting doesn't work with my old theme, so it's back to the default look for now.  I'll try to find something soon, I don't particularly care for this.
