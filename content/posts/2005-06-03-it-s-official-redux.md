Here's the listing text.  Punctuation and capitalization have not been changed to embarrass the guilty.

> CAPE WITH FULL FRONT PORCH AND FULL DORMER IN REAR. VERY LARGE BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS. EXTERIOR PAINTED IN 2004, BRAND NEW HEAT PUMP, KITCHEN FLOOR BEING REPLACED PRIOR TO CLOSING, REPLACEMENT WINDOWS IN REAR OF HOME. QUIET STREET

This is all true, except for the "quiet street" part.  It might not see a lot of car traffic, but it's a very active portion of the neighborhood.

It's a 4/2, with two large bedrooms upstairs.  We're planning on having one be the master, and the other a den.  Megan floated the term "football room" during our original walkthrough, which she is living to regret.  On the ground floor will be a nice (but small) living room, a sizable kitchen that needs a little work, a guest room, and a study.

Everything is painted white, which is an improvement over the *sponge painting on every wall* that was in place when the sellers originally purchased the home.

The neighborhood has a pool and tennis courts.  One court is within walking distance from our place.  That will be a _welcome return_.  (Wow, how do people even put up with me?) (ed. note: haha got'em)

It's in a really good school district, the roof will be fine for another decade, the appliances conveyed, and I'm very excited.

The sellers are going to be living there until near the end of the month.  That gives me time to round up my stuff here and get my apartment rented.  My lease required _90 days notice_, which is kind of outrageous, but my only requirement to get out of the lease is to find a new tenant.  Those are the projects now, getting packed and finding someone to come live in the nicest place I've ever called my own.
