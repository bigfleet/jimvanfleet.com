If you are using FireFox, I urge you to accept my invitation to [Outfoxed](http://getoutfoxed.com).  It's like del.icio.us, but much better.  It's a true chance to collaborate with friends and those you may be acquanted with while visiting web pages.  It's a little bumpy right now, but I guarantee you that I'll be using it.
