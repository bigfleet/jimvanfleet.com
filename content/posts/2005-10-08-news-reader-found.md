I started using the [Omea News Reader](http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/reader/) from JetBrains today, and I really liked how easy it was to process my blogroll into a useable form.  I'll keep you updated if there is better software for Windows, but this will definitely do for now!  I like it quite a bit.
