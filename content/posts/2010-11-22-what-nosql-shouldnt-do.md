[What NoSQL Shouldn't Do](http://cloudeventprocessing.com/2010/11/20/wrong-complex-event-processing/): 

> "The idea was that we were ushering in a New Way To Compute Things.  Like all technologists who spend way too much time thinking about this stuff, we thought everyone would immediately see how smart we were, run out and buy one of the CEP based products, and join us in revolutionizing how data is turned into information and used by business folk to make money and pay our salaries.  The only problem is, we forgot 2 things; 1) who would be using our software to do this work, and 2) who would subsequently be using the applications developed by 1."

Does this sound familiar?
