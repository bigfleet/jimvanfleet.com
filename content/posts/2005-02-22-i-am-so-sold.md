In the past few weeks, I've put together a very simple Rails application that touches some of the functionality available.  A full write-up will come when I'm done with the project and can really do the tutorial right.  (I don't want to be spreading misinformation!)

It's been 100% awesome.  I thought my first experience with <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> was impressive (and it was, for Java), but I've been blown away by how easy it is to do what I'm doing.

In addition, the new Routing features in Rails and the new "low-level" component capabilities have me salivating.  I promise to take some time  very shortly to write up my impressions of Ruby at this stage.
