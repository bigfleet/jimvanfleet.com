2005 was a really big year, and if 2006 is anything like it, my 27th year on earth will see quite a lot.

### Geek Stuff

I'm a gigantic nerd, so it's not too much of a surprise that this section is pretty busy.  I got my first #1 ranking on Google, even though the current search  yields no love.

I started to [really work with open-source operating systems](../2005-01-24-geek-cred), a trend which continues to the current day.  I'm posting this from Ubuntu, which I hope to write about soon.  (OK, I'm not-- but I could have been.)

I drank the [Ruby On Rails](../2005-02-22-i-am-so-sold) koolaid, even though I don't really see my opinions on it represented on the blogosphere.  I know that because I [entered it](../2005-05-12-an-example) during 2005.

I [anted up](../2005-06-03-trac-and-txd) for a lifetime of shared hosting at TextDrive.  I should reach break-even next year at some point.  I made that move, in part, to [move to a new blogging platform](../2005-09-04-what-took-you-so-long).

And even though it's probably of more personal interest, I'll include [getting my new job](../2005-09-30-a-new-job) under this section.


### Personal Milestone

Beyond the [new job](../2005-09-30-a-new-job), there was the [new house](../2005-05-11-raise-high-the-roof-beam-carpenters) with its [ridiculous listing](../2005-06-03-it-s-official-redux).  There were many trials and tribulations; so many, in fact, that I stopped writing about them in the middle, although the concerns are minor in the grand scheme of things.  I couldn't be happier with my house, even through all the little nits and picks.  For those of you interested in buying a house, I highly recommend it, especially if there's an [IKEA nearby to fleece](../2005-06-16-weekly-update-2).  Just be prepared for *a lot* of the unexpected.

While buying the house was not a direct outgrowth of [my desire to increase my financial literacy](../2005-03-09-wheres-my-beer), my [exploration of the real estate market](../2005-05-25-all-about-the-benjamins) certainly was.  So was [starting my first business](../2005-05-25-it-s-official).

Also, I celebrated my [first anniversary of dating Megan](../2005-10-19-megan-and-me)  with a wonderful [Thanksgiving](../2005-11-25-happy-holidays) and [Christmas season](../2006-01-01-happy-new-year).

### And, Finally


[I got a digital camera](../2005-05-13-my-friend-flickr).  Hooray!
