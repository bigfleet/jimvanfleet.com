* If you're using Subversion and Eclipse,  Subclipse is not ready.  [TortoiseSVN](https://tortoisesvn.net/) is much closer.
* [fValidate](https://code.google.com/archive/p/fvalidate/) is, bar-none, the best client side validation library I've yet found.  Integrating it with WebWork should be a snap, and we may even get to see what XMLHttpRequest and WebWork can back it up with.
* If you're getting into web standards, and like me, want everything to validate, remember that you're on the cutting edge.  Not even Mozilla/Gecko/FireFox is perfect, so you may have to work around some bugs by hand in IE when you want to extend your <span class="caps">DTD</span>.
