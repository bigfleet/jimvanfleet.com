Melvin Goes To Dinner was put together by the Mr. Show guys for Showtime.  "Aren't they on <span class="caps">HBO</span>" you ask?  Well, sure.  But this is not Mr. Show.  This is basically one of those really exciting conversations you have with a group of friends when you're all a little over enthusiastic because you've been drinking all night.  They talk about religion, sex, old boyfriends and new girlfriends, relationships, and the astral plane.

They pulled it off pretty well!  The movie definitely picks up steam as it rolls along, and if you know me, you know I'm a sucker for pontification.  I give it a *7.9/10*.  It's funny but you definitely will not kick yourself if you never see this movie.  I would definitely recommend an evening with your real friends over it.
