Wow, that pun is a bit much, even for me.

At any rate, Ive now [installed Trac on Fedora Core 3](https://trac.edgewall.org/) in conjunction with my project which is now coming down the home stretch.

Im really excited about this.  Even if I dont get any additional use from it, the repository browsing capabilities are intriguing.

More on this situation as it develops.
