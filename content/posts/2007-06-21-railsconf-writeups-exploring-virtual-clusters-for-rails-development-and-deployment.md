Unfortunately for the fellow at [RailsMachine](http://www.railsmachine.com/), this talk is an area that I'm really trying to stay abreast of.  I historically have had very little money to spend on architecture, and the concept of virtualization has had a huge impact on my professional development.  As such, I thought that I would give some time to a practitioner in this space that wasn't Joyent


Applying the concept of virtualization to Rails deployment is something I've already done, and his presentation was more about his offerings than how he engineered them.  Any development shop that is concerned with how they will run their product when it becomes successful should have had both ears open.  I have been spending a lot of time on this, though, so it wasn't so useful for me.  I'm sure others had a different experience.
