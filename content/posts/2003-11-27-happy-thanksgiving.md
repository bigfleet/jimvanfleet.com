Guess who cooked today's hit dish?  I can't claim all the credit.  Mom had the recipe (bourbon sweet potatos) and helped with the prep.  But I did most of the work!  I also put together the sausage dressing, but that wasn't nearly as good.  This was the most I remember enjoying a Thanksgiving in quite some time.

And the Packers and the Cowboys got beat.  How great is that?
