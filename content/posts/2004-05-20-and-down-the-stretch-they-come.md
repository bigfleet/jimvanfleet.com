[StatCVS](http://statcvs.sourceforge.net/) reports that I've just recently cleared 10,000 lines of code.  A lot of those are in the JFreeReport code that I've just recently added, but I think they still count.

There's a launch date of June 1, so I'll get next week to do the straightening up and fixing a few known defects.  Then it'll be off to the races!

I'm so fortunate at how this week has turned out.  One week ago today, it seemed like the project was already in the yellow and headed quickly towards the red.  I caught one last break, having good luck with laying out those reports myself.  So here we are!

Be on the lookout in the near future for write-ups and notes of my future progress.  June should be a good month for learning!
