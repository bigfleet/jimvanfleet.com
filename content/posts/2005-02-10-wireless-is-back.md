After Megan got her new iBook, we were both interested in having wireless in the house.  Since my router has had a cold _or something_ for months, I figured we'd try to move my router to her place, and I'd get a new one.  One that worked.

It happened last night!  I checked my e-mail from my living room!  I love that.

Also, there was apparently a piece on the Richmond evening news last night about [war driving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving).  I got an apparently useful wireless security system in place, thankfully.
