I've recently completed enough work on jsCalcLib to feel like it's good enough to release for public consumption.  Perfect?  No.  Good enough?  Absolutely.  Wish I wouldn't have had to write it in the first place, anyway.

So, now I'm in the position of selecting an [open-source license](https://opensource.org/licenses/) for the code.  I guess that the <span class="caps">LGPL</span> is the clubhouse leader, but I will enjoy looking over the alternatives.

Look for more information soon on a new SourceForge project!
