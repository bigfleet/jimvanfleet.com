I'm making this post from my new Palm C.  It's got the proverbial Wi-Fi.   I was excited about the prospect of posting _horrendous as it may seem_ from Starbucks and the like.    Fortunately, the prices are exorbitant, so I can pretend I'm cool for a little while longer.

Let's hope that it leads to more posts from me!
