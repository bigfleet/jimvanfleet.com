Hibernate [Hibern8IDE](https://hibernate.org/tools/) has recently hit 1.0 or 0.9, depending on where you're looking at the moment.  Regardless, it's an excellent product.  One of the features I appreciated about Dreamweaver was quick and dirty <span class="caps">SQL</span> statement editing.  This can bring the same features to Hibernate use, only now the queries are much more powerful!
