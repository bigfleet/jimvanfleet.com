My dad was reading {{<amzn asin="3OHXonI" title="The Art of Happiness">}} by the Dalai Lama on an airplane.  His neighbor asked him if it was any good.  That's where it all started.

Turns out he was from Rice, a religious studies major.  (He actually knows the guy who masterminded the Willie's statue escapade!)  He was interested in my particulars since my dad said I was looking for work.  We met for dinner about a week ago and had a great interview.  I took on a little project for them, and they must have liked how that turned out, because I'm now an employee!</p>

For tax purposes, who knows exactly how it'll look.  But I have a monthly salary, and that's all I was looking for.  Prospects look good for long term work there.  I couldn't be more excited.</p>
