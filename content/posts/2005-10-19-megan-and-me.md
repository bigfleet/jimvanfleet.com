Today is the one year anniversary of my first date with Megan Epp.

I realize that I haven't posted very much here about Megan, but that hasn't been because she's not very important to me.  Indeed, nothing could be further from the truth.

I met Megan online at [OKCupid](http://www.okcupid.com/") which is an absolutely fantastic site.  Another of Megan's friends met her boyfriend through OKCupid, and now both couples are living together.


Megan and I were friends for several months before I worked up the courage to ask her out.  I planned and planned, because it was very important to me that no matter whether she wanted to go out with me or not, that we remained friends.  I can have difficulty making new friends, as it often takes me a little while to warm up to a new locale, and I knew from the first time we met at [World Cup](https://richmondva.wordpress.com/2007/04/09/world-cup-coffee-closing/) that she would be a good friend.

Since we started dating, we haven't spent very much time apart voluntarily.  That's what makes it so hard to write about her!  She's always looking over my shoulder!  (I'm just kidding, baby.)

Megan and I formed a trusting relationship very quickly, and she's been more understanding of my mental state than I ever could have expected.

Living together hasn't made us any more angry at each other, but we do have to watch our tendencies to buy *cool stuff* including Megan's beloved shoe collection.

She has an incredible ability to pick me up when I am down, and to calm me down when I am nervous or upset.  She challenges me to be my best, and *lord knows* I can't get away with anything around her.

She's all I could ever ask for.  I just wanted to let you all know that.
