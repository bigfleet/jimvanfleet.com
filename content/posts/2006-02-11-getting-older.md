I turn 27 on February 13.  That seems pretty old to me.  My man Dan Castle hypothesizes that it may be the extra syllable, and I believe that factor cannot be discounted.

I must say that I am more and more disconcerted by the difference in ages between myself and college athletes.  (I am a big sports fan, after all.)

I don't have any reason to belabor this point, but I thought I'd throw it out there.  27 seems a lot more odd to me than seeing 2006 for the first time, but I suppose that I'll have to get over it.
