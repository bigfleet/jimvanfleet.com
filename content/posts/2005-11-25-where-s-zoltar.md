While working on retooling my sister's old laptop so that Dad can use it, I also managed to update [>my Amazon wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1SOWWGWI7I8X3?ref_=wl_share) so that interested parties would know exactly what I was after.  I had to delete quite a few things since I had actually already purchased them.  Good times.
