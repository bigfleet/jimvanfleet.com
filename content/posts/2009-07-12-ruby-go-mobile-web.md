The PhoneGap guys are trying to bring development with web standards to the mobile platform, specifically by leveraging WebKit, which is available and/or used on basically all platforms but the BlackBerry.  That seems like a hell of a goal to me.In part because of their goofy PhoneGap slides, the PhoneGap project seems like a bunch of hackers taking a good idea and giving it their all.  I find the concept of web standards incredibly appealing and have felt that way for many years.  The fact that a technical team can attempt to move development forward by making web standards seem like "native" with a sort of starter project that includes an API of its own.

They are also getting very excited about the Joyent Smart Platform and its full-stack JavaScript approach.  This certainly fits right in with using web standards all the way to the client.

I'm interested to see where they go with this, for sure.
