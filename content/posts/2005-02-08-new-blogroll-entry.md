I've added [Creating Passionate Users](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/) to my blogroll at the lower left.  I could tell you how awesome the site is, or you could just visit.

(ed. note: a [heartbreaking ending](https://www.wired.com/2007/04/kathy-sierra-case-few-clues-little-evidence-much-controversy/) though much of her original content remains.  A blog roll is... quite the thought.)
