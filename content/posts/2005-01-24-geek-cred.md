Last week, I installed Apache 2 and Subversion from source tarballs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.  I've never managed to pull off anything even remotely that awesome.

Since I'm not going to get my own special <span class="caps">RHEL</span> license just to run on VMWare, I've moved to a Fedora Core 3 installation.  I really feel like I'm starting to learn my way around Linux, which is nice.  It's just the killer installation process aligning with the installed hardware!
