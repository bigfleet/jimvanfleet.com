So, I'm back from Maryville.  It was a great trip.  I had a blast hanging out with Jess and Jenn.  I can tell Jenn appreciated my visit because she must have thanked me fifteen times on the ride back from a party on Saturday night.  If you're reading this, really, it was my pleasure.

I'm planning on getting back sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I'd love to go down every weekend, but looks like I'll have to work on some of them coming up!
