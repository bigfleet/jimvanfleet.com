I have been working at TradeKing since the beginning of September, and the site that I (and others) have been working on will be launched to the public tomorrow.

It's a great site, and I am very happy with my change in brokerage, regardless of my employment status.  If you are a stockholder, consider transferring your assets to TradeKing.  You can't beat the price, and the customer support is top-notch.  You also get to play around and shoot me nasty messages if you find any bugs in the community site.  What could be better than that?
