After getting a link from [Dave Thomas](https://pragdave.me/blog/2005/06/15/knee-testing.html), I checked out the link below.  Following some leads from that blog, I uncovered Watir: Web Application Testing in Ruby.  Watir is designed to drive Internet Explorer (yes, that Internet Explorer) using a Ruby script.


This sounds like a dream addition to the testing stack.  Especially if this is a way to slip Ruby in the door.  Stay tuned for more details.
