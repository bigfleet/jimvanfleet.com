I'm getting a new laptop!  Once again, it's not technically mine, it's being bought by <span class="caps">OPGI</span>.  The next computer I buy for personal use will be an Apple, I vow.  This one would have been an Apple as well, but it appears that one of the tools I'd like to use for my web application development project will only work on PC.  It's written in Java, so one would expect it would work anywhere, but not a lot of people are supporting the tool, and-- really-- what can you do?


It's a Dell Latitude 800, and I'll love it as if it were my own.  I'm only checking to see if it's finally been boxed every half hour.  Torturous!
