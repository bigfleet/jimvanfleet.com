Yeah, that's right.  I finally gave in and started a blog.  Maybe there's a chance that the 'small changes' idea of the blog will actually finally solve my problem of not being able to assemble a ton of content all at once.

I'll be experimenting with the form of things and thinking through the structure I'd like to have in place here.  But mostly I'm doing this just to feel good, my past couple of days have really sucked.
