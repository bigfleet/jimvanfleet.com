* I just got bundled up in a jacket, earmuffs, and mittens to rake off my back lawn, after the landlord finally got his minions to clean out the trash that they had dropped off in the yard after cleaning out the basement.

* I have now copied a bunch of CDs for my mom to support her <span class="caps">CISV</span> habit.  I need to do the same for myself and get a couple of sites uploaded and updated.

* My pumpkin looks cool.  I took a picture.  Even though I haven't gone the digital camera route yet, I can get pictures done on CD for a little extra.  I really need to get more of my pictures on the web.

That's all for now, I'm going to get a shower.
