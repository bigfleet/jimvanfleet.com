With my recent interest in [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org), I learned about 43 things when it came out.  43 Things is written using that platform.  Today, I got word that [Amazon has invested in 43 Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/43_Things).  Sure, the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of 43 Things used to work there, but there's probably something cooking.

Ruby is a great language, and it'll be interesting to me to see if it continues to be a bigger deal.
