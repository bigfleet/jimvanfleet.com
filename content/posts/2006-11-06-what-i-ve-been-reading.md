* {{<amzn asin=4wX4I3G title="American Sphinx">}}, which reminded me that it is time to acquaint myself more closely with American political history-- beginning with </li>
* {{<amzn asin=3guaAVz title="Team Of Rivals">}}, a recent Abraham Lincoln biography.  Lincoln was born during Jefferson's administration, though I wonder if it's possible for the two men to be more different.
* [Studies in Mutualist Political Economy](http://mutualist.org/id47.html) which I am slightly less than half way through.  I'm reading this one to inform discussions with Jeremy.  It does appear that we are getting to the good part.
