## Doubt

Faith and I were not a natural fit.

In Sunday School, presented with the story of Noah's Ark, I asked "So God killed everything on earth, except the creatures Noah saved?  He flooded the whole Earth?"

"What did they do that was so bad?"

It was not a conversation the Sunday School teachers welcomed.  My takeaway was: this is a ruse.  I got them!  I was probably not yet ten years old.

Becoming a teenager, this (non-)belief deepened.  I saw the levers of fear and control, and ignored everything else.
