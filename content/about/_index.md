Hello, everyone.  I appreciate you spending some time with me.

I was born in East Tennessee, which is a very beautiful place.  Lacking in
imagination, I found it boring as a young man.  

I went to school in Houston, TX at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) 
which was wonderful.  Houston offers access to many thrills, several of 
which I overindulged.  Compared to East Tennessee, it is not a very nice 
place to be.  You can see a yellow-brown dome over the city from miles away.
Occasionally, it just smells awful.  It was a swamp, after all.

When the time came to leave Houston, I went to Richmond, Virginia.  It was
very lovely.  I took my first steps in my career, as well as in finding
my technical community.  I met my wife, and several dear friends. At the time,
moving to Charlotte was bittersweet.

The bitterness has been forgotten. We've thrived in Charlotte. I love its
mixture of the big city and small town. When I look at the window at my
office, it's trees as far as the eye can see.  There's been tremendous
personal and professional opportunity here, and for that I am very
grateful.

My wife Megan and I have had two sons.  One plays piano, and the other loves
Pokemon cards.  We have three huskies.
